# Roadmap 🛣️
Below are the roamaps for becoming an efficient web developer and/or Quality Assurance(QA) tester. 

## Purpose of these roamaps? 🎯 
The main purpose of these roadmaps is to view the available landscape of tools & technologies for the respected profession/career path and to steer the learning process in an ordered flow.  

These roadmaps cover everything that is there to learn for the paths listed below. Learners should never feel overwhelmed with this; these are not meant to make them go in tutorial or learning hell, but instead it is aimed to show a definite learning flow. 

## How to use it? 💻
The recommended way is to start from top of the desired learning path and get a good understanding on all the sub-topics. Then, repeat this same process for each career path until the end of the roadmap.
